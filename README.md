  Personally this was my least favorite lab as what I created was not very interesting. I hope to create a better website in the future.     My Mom used to make hats and sell them and she is starting to do it again, so I might make a website for her.

Toughest code so far!
```Java
 while(endX < 300){
    
    stroke(r1,r2,r3);
    endX = startX + (int)(Math.random()*10);
    endY = startY + (int)(Math.random()*19)-9;
    line(startX,startY,endX,endY);
    startX = endX;
    startY = endY;
    
  }
  ```
